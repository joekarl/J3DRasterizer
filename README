Idea is to make a standalone 3d renderer without using opengl or anything like that.
Renderer could be used for generating anything that needs a 3d scene (games, simulations, etc....)

Will hopefully support:
 - texture mapping
 - vertex shaders
 - fragment shaders
 - backface culling
 - z-buffer
 - lighting?
 - shadows???
 - reflections!!?!?!?

It'll be a bit slow because its written in Java, but thats part of the challenge....
